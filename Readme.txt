This is my job for the proposed project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course from Coursera. The first step was the collection of the data and all the information 
from the site http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and the last task was the submission of the project to reviewing 
from my peers.

The authors of the original experiments worked with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, 
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and 
gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label 
the data manually. The obtained dataset has beenrandomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 
30% the test data. This data is part of the baseline for this project.

This delivery includes the following files:
=========================================

- Readme.txt      : This file.
- README.md       : The file with the scripts and explanation to complete this project.
- CodeBook.md     : Description of the variables, the data and the transformations for this project.
- secondData.txt  : The final product of the scripts.
- run_analysis.R  : R file containing the clean code.
